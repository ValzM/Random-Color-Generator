# Random-Color-Generator

I did this project to improve my knowledge in Javascript.

## Description

This project allows you to generate random colors and gradients and copy them to your clipboard.
Moreover, you have a history that saves all your color generation (resets each time the page reloads).
It has been designed to be used in a css code.
You can generate the following colors and gradients:

  - Random color
  - Bright color
  - Pastel color
  - Dark color
  - Random gradient
  - Bright gradient
  - Pastel gradient
  - Dark gradient
 
 If you lack inspiration to find colors, feel free to use this project !
